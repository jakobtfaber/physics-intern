# OpenDirac

A multi-agent scaffolding system for autonomous scientific research in mathematics and theoretical physics.

## What is this?

OpenDirac takes a problem stated in plain language (e.g. "derive the Hawking temperature from the Euclidean path integral") and works through it autonomously — breaking it into sub-problems, performing derivations, writing and running verification code, and critically reviewing its own results — until it produces a coherent, verified solution.

The project ships two research modes: a **multi-agent pipeline** (the default) that orchestrates nine specialised roles, and **Autophysicist**, a lighter single-agent loop where one Research Manager dispatches ephemeral sub-agents on the fly.

**Multi-agent pipeline.** Nine specialised LLM agent roles take turns in a loop. A **surveyor** maps the research landscape before the main loop begins. A **planner** produces the initial research strategy (and can revise it when critiques demand). The **orchestrator** dispatches research questions to a **researcher** (analytical reasoning) or **computer** (code execution), and formulates working hypotheses from the evidence. Then the **reviewer** provides adversarial review (auto-triggered).  A **deep critic** periodically audits strategy and inter-result coherence, filing typed critiques that are routed back to the **planner** (for strategy revision) or to an **adjudicator** (for challenges on established results). Finally a **formatter** produces a clean `ANSWER.md` from the final research state.

No agent carries conversation history: each call starts from a fresh context. All research state lives in a structured `ResearchState` object — agents mutate it via tools, and Markdown files are rendered from it for git snapshots. The workspace is version-controlled with git, so every step is recoverable.

Supports multiple LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, HuggingFace) via a provider abstraction layer with a `models.yaml` registry.


## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (requires Python 3.12+ and uv)
uv sync --extra testing

# For non-Anthropic providers, install the relevant extra:
uv sync --extra openai          # OpenAI
uv sync --extra google          # Google Gemini
uv sync --extra huggingface     # HuggingFace Inference Providers
uv sync --extra all-providers   # all of the above

# To serve local models on a Linux GPU cluster (no-op on macOS):
uv sync --extra local


# Run a research problem (requires model API key in .env or env var)
uv run open_dirac problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml --model gemini-3-flash-preview
```

### Continuous Integration

On pull requests and pushes to `main`/`master`, GitHub Actions runs Ruff (lint + format check) and pytest (Python 3.12 and 3.13). For the same checks locally:

```bash
uv sync --extra quality --extra testing
uv run ruff check tests src scripts serve
uv run ruff format --check tests src scripts serve
uv run python -m pytest ./tests/
```

### Environment Variables

Set API keys for the providers you want to use (in `.env` or as env vars):

| Variable | Provider |
|----------|----------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Anthropic |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | OpenAI |
| `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | Google Gemini (default) |
| `HF_TOKEN` | HuggingFace Inference Providers |

### CLI Options

```
open_dirac [problem.yaml] [options]

  problem.yaml                Problem YAML file (default: problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml)
  --model MODEL               LLM model key (default: from config.default.yaml, resolved via models.yaml)
  --replay DIR                Replay console log from a workspace (no run)
  --max-iterations N          Max loop iterations (default: see config.default.yaml)
  --workspace-dir DIR         Workspace directory (default: workspaces/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<problem>)
  --resume DIR                Resume from existing workspace if DIR exists
  --config FILE               Path to config YAML file (overrides defaults)
```

### Configuration

All defaults live in `config.default.yaml` (single source of truth). Override with a config YAML file (`--config`) or individual CLI flags. The precedence is: CLI flags > config file > `config.default.yaml`.

The `max_output_tokens` budget per LLM call is **not** a general default — it is defined per-model in `models.yaml` and cannot be overridden via CLI or config YAML.

#### Soft-exit triggers

In addition to `max_iterations`, the loop accepts three optional cumulative budgets — `max_wall_seconds`, `max_total_output_tokens`, and `max_cost_usd` (USD, computed from `models.yaml` pricing). All default to `0` (disabled). When any gate fires, the loop finishes its current iteration and a forced formatter writes a best-effort `ANSWER.md` (status: `partially_complete`); the triggering gate name appears in the final commit message. `max_wall_seconds` is per-`run()` invocation — it restarts on resume; the token and cost budgets are cumulative across resumes.

To grant more budget after a soft-exit and continue the run, delete `ANSWER.md` and re-run with `--resume`. `ANSWER.md` is the canonical "this run is done" signal: present ⇒ resume refuses; absent ⇒ resume resets `partially_complete` to `in_progress` and continues from the last committed iteration.

#### Periodic best-guess snapshots

Setting `best_guess_every_n: N` (default `0` = disabled) makes the forced formatter run every N iterations and write `BEST_GUESS.md` as a side artifact, with its own commit. The snapshot never touches `ANSWER.md`, `RESEARCH_STATE.md`, or any other state agents see — purely an observability aid.

### Verification

After a run completes, you can independently verify the scientific results using a stronger model (Claude Opus by default):

```bash
# Verify a completed workspace
uv run python -m open_dirac.verification workspaces/<run_dir>/

# Run + verify in one command
./scripts/run_and_verify.sh --max-iterations 10
```

```
python -m open_dirac.verification <workspace_dir> [options]

  --model MODEL              LLM model (default: claude-4.6-opus)
```

The verifier writes `VERIFICATION.md` into the workspace. It evaluates each Established Result for mathematical/physical validity, runs a process audit, checks chain coherence between results, and outputs a verdict: VALID, PARTIALLY_VALID, INVALID, or INCONCLUSIVE. The problem definition is auto-loaded from `problem.yaml` in the workspace (copied there by `main.py` at run start).

### Autophysicist

Autophysicist is a single-agent iterative research mode. A Research Manager receives the problem, dispatches ephemeral sub-agents (with optional sandboxed code execution), and records results in two memory systems — a permanent memory (append-only, always visible) and a scratchpad (rolling window of the last N entries). Each iteration starts from a fresh context; the Manager can only "remember" what it wrote to memory. A per-iteration token budget triggers a wind-down phase that removes the sub-agent dispatch tool, forcing the Manager to consolidate and end the turn.

When the Manager is confident in a solution it calls `submit_final_answer`, which terminates the run and triggers formal evaluation (symbolic SymPy comparison + numerical fallback) against the ground truth in the problem YAML.

```bash
# Run a single problem
uv run open_dirac_autophysicist problems/tier1/hydrogen_fine_structure.yaml --model claude-4.6-opus

# With custom budget and iteration limits
uv run open_dirac_autophysicist problems/tier1/hydrogen_fine_structure.yaml \
  --max-iterations 30 --token-budget 100000 --tool-call-cap 20

# Resume an interrupted run
uv run open_dirac_autophysicist problems/tier1/hydrogen_fine_structure.yaml \
  --resume workspaces/<run_dir>
```

```
open_dirac_autophysicist <problem.yaml> [options]

  problem.yaml                Problem YAML file (required)
  --model MODEL               LLM model key (default: from config.default.yaml)
  --config FILE               Path to config YAML file
  --max-iterations N          Max Manager iterations (default: 50)
  --token-budget N            Per-iteration token budget for wind-down trigger (default: 64000)
  --tool-call-cap N           Max tool calls per iteration (default: 15)
  --max-rounds N              Max LLM rounds per iteration (default: 30)
  --scratchpad-window N       Visible scratchpad entries (default: 5)
  --sandbox-timeout N         Code execution timeout in seconds (default: 60)
  --workspace-dir DIR         Workspace directory (default: auto-generated)
  --resume DIR                Resume from an existing workspace
```

#### Multiple concurrent runs (pass@k)

Run N independent instances on the same problem to collect pass@k statistics:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_multiple_autophysicist.py problems/tier1/hydrogen_fine_structure.yaml \
  --runs 20 --concurrency 5 --model claude-4.6-opus --max-iterations 30
```

Results are written to a JSON file with per-run metrics and an aggregate summary (correct / incorrect / inconclusive / no_answer counts).

### One-shot Baseline

Run a single LLM call on a problem with no scaffolding — useful for benchmarking raw model capability against the multi-agent pipeline:

```bash
uv run python -m open_dirac.one_shot problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml
uv run python -m open_dirac.one_shot problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml --model gpt-5.4-high
uv run python -m open_dirac.one_shot problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml --runs 10  # multiple runs for statistics
uv run python -m open_dirac.one_shot problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml --config my_config.yaml
```

```
python -m open_dirac.one_shot <problem.yaml> [options]

  --model MODEL              LLM model key (default: from config.default.yaml)
  --config FILE              Path to config YAML file (overrides defaults)
  --runs N                   Number of runs for batch benchmarking
  --output-dir DIR           Directory for batch result JSON files (default: results/one_shot/)
  -o FILE                    Save response with metadata to a Markdown file
```

Answers are auto-evaluated against the known answer in the problem YAML (symbolic SymPy comparison + numerical fallback).

### RSA (Recursive Self-Aggregation)

RSA maintains a population of N candidate solutions and iteratively refines them by aggregating random subsets of K candidates over T rounds (total LLM calls = N * T). The final answer is chosen by majority vote.

```bash
uv run python -m open_dirac.rsa problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml
uv run python -m open_dirac.rsa problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml -N 6 -K 2 -T 4
uv run python -m open_dirac.rsa problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml --model gpt-5.4-high --concurrency 4
uv run python -m open_dirac.rsa problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml --config my_config.yaml
```

```
python -m open_dirac.rsa <problem.yaml> [options]

  --model MODEL              LLM model key (default: from config.default.yaml)
  -N INT                     Population size (default: 6)
  -K INT                     Aggregation subset size (default: 2)
  -T INT                     Number of rounds (default: 4)
  --config FILE              Path to config YAML file (overrides defaults)
  --concurrency N            Max parallel LLM calls within a round (default: N)
  --workspace-dir DIR        Workspace directory (default: auto-generated under workspaces/)
  -o FILE                    Save response with metadata to a Markdown file
```

Each run creates a workspace under `workspaces/<timestamp>_<problem>_<model>_rsa/` containing `PROBLEM.md`, `ANSWER.md`, `VERIFICATION.md`, `config.json`, and `rsa_result.json` (full per-round metrics).

#### Multiple concurrent RSA runs (pass@k)

Run N independent RSA instances on the same problem to collect pass@k statistics:

```bash
uv run python scripts/run_multiple_rsa.py problems/critpt/yaml/Challenge_1_main.yaml \
  --runs 10 --concurrency 3 -N 6 -K 2 -T 4 --model claude-4.6-opus
```

Each run produces its own workspace at `workspaces/<timestamp>_<problem>_<model>_rsa_runNNN/` (same naming pattern as the other modes), and an aggregate summary JSON is written to `results/multiple_rsa/`. Note that each RSA run itself fans out up to N concurrent LLM calls, so effective in-flight calls ≈ `--concurrency × N`.

### Serving Local Models with vLLM

Running a local model is a two-step process: first **serve** the model with vLLM, then **run** the problem against it.

#### End-to-end example (Nemotron Super 120B)

```bash
# Step 1 — Serve the model (submits a Slurm job; returns immediately)
./serve/serve.slurm \
  --model nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16 \
  --nodes 1 \
  --gpus-per-node 8

# Note the Slurm job ID printed to stdout, e.g. 12345.
# Connection details are written to serve/logs/vllm/<job_id>/endpoint.env
# as soon as the job starts (before the model finishes loading).

# Step 2 — Run a problem against the served model
# eval.slurm reads endpoint.env, waits for vLLM to be healthy (up to 4 h),
# then launches the evaluation.
./serve/eval.slurm \
  --model nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16 \
  --problem problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml \
  --serve-job 12345
```

#### Huge-model example (GLM-5.1)

`zai-org/GLM-5.1` runs on 3 H100 nodes with the default `models.yaml` serve
config. The script pins DeepGEMM's JIT cache to `/fsx` and uses the loaded
CUDA 12.9 toolkit so GLM can run without `--enforce-eager`.

```bash
./serve/serve.slurm \
  --model zai-org/GLM-5.1 \
  --nodes 3 \
  --gpus-per-node 8

./serve/eval.slurm \
  --model zai-org/GLM-5.1 \
  --problem problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml \
  --serve-job <JOB_ID>
```

`zai-org/GLM-5.1` is very large; in our Slurm tests it required 3 nodes (`--nodes 3`) with 8 GPUs per node.

#### Prerequisites

- `uv sync --extra local`
- `uv run hf auth whoami`
- The `local` extra installs `vllm`, the required `transformers` floor, and the
  vendored `deep-gemm` wheel from `[tool.uv.sources]`; no manual DeepGEMM install
  is needed for `zai-org/GLM-5.1`.
- vendored Nemotron parser plugins live in `serve/reasoning_parsers/`

#### Step 1: Serve the model

Use `serve/serve.slurm`. The script self-submits with `sbatch`, launches one `vllm serve` rank per allocated node, stores Slurm logs under `serve/logs/`, and writes connection details to `serve/logs/vllm/<job_id>/endpoint.env`.

For huge local models, the default serve wall time is 24 hours and `serve/eval.slurm` will wait up to 4 hours for the endpoint to become healthy before giving up.

```bash
# Qwen on 1 node, 1 GPU
./serve/serve.slurm \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B \
  --nodes 1 \
  --gpus-per-node 1 \
  --reasoning-parser qwen3

# Nemotron Nano on 1 node, 1 GPU
./serve/serve.slurm \
  --model nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16 \
  --nodes 1 \
  --gpus-per-node 1

# Nemotron Super on 2 nodes, 8 GPUs per node
./serve/serve.slurm \
  --model nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16 \
  --nodes 2 \
  --gpus-per-node 8

# GLM-5.1 on 3 nodes, 8 GPUs per node
./serve/serve.slurm \
  --model zai-org/GLM-5.1 \
  --nodes 3 \
  --gpus-per-node 8

# Kimi-K2.6: auto-launches 4 replicas (PP=2 each, 8 nodes total)
./serve/serve.slurm --model moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6

# Nemotron Cascade on 1 node, 1 GPU
./serve/serve.slurm \
  --model nvidia/Nemotron-Cascade-2-30B-A3B \
  --nodes 1 \
  --gpus-per-node 1
```

The `--reasoning-parser` flag is exposed directly. Use it to enable built-in parsers such as `qwen3`. For `nano_v3` and `super_v3`, the script automatically attaches the matching plugin file from `serve/reasoning_parsers`.

#### Performance tuning notes for huge models

Per-model `vllm_args` in `models.yaml` already encode the fastest configuration we found on our cluster (H100 80 GB nodes, WekaFS-backed weights). The full experiment log is in the comments above each entry; the headline results:

Load times below are wall time of `default_loader.py` "Loading weights took N seconds" on the slowest worker. They depend heavily on whether the OS page cache is warm.

| Model | Tput (single req) | Tput (8-way batch) | Tput (16-way batch) | Load (cold cache) | Load (warm cache) | Notes |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `zai-org/GLM-5.1`      | ~46 tok/s | ~202 tok/s | ~333 tok/s | ~2.5h projected without prefetch | ~18-22 min with prefetch in the final run; earlier warm run was ~2 min | DeepGEMM JIT cache/toolkit setup lets this run without `--enforce-eager`; BF16 beats FP8 on our stack. |
| `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` | ~99 tok/s | ~558 tok/s | ~920 tok/s | ~78 min without prefetch; prefetch on cold cache untested | ~6-11 min with warm cache | CUDA graphs (no `--enforce-eager`) give the dominant 4× throughput win; `--enable-expert-parallel` remains the chosen default. With external DP (N replicas × PP=2), aggregate throughput scales near-linearly: 5 replicas → 11,250 tok/s. |

For an apples-to-apples 4-node comparison, GLM-5.1 with TP=8/PP=4 measured
~46 tok/s single-request, ~257 tok/s at 8-way concurrency, and ~383 tok/s at
16-way concurrency. That improves aggregate throughput over the 3-node default,
but not single-request latency, and the gain is smaller than the extra 33% GPU
cost, so the default stays at 3 nodes.

Kimi-K2.6 also fits on fewer nodes. With the same canonical flags:

| Kimi nodes | Tput (single req) | Tput (8-way batch) | Tput (16-way batch) | Full-context KV headroom | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|--------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| 2 | ~94 tok/s | ~569 tok/s | ~938 tok/s | 3.83× at 262k context | Best short-prompt cost/perf, but risky for full 8-way long-context sweeps. |
| 3 | ~92 tok/s | ~547 tok/s | ~920 tok/s | 7.48× at 262k context | Almost enough for 8-way full-context use, still less headroom than 4 nodes. |
| 4 | ~92 tok/s | ~558 tok/s | ~920 tok/s | 11.12× at 262k context | Chosen default for robust 8-way CritPt runs. |

Kimi's `max_output_tokens` is intentionally `200000`. The old 131k cap left
five hard one-shot CritPt problems without parseable answer code; rerunning just
those with the higher cap completed the full 70/70 submission set.

Kimi also needs vLLM's `kimi_k2` tool and reasoning parsers for the full
OpenDirac agent harness. The one-shot harness works without tools, but the
agent loop sends OpenAI-style tool calls; vLLM rejects `tool_choice="auto"`
unless the server is launched with `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and
`--tool-call-parser kimi_k2`.

Two flags worth knowing whenever you add a new huge model on a networked filesystem:

- `--safetensors-load-strategy prefetch` — pulls all shards into the OS page cache via background threads. Mandatory on WekaFS / Lustre / NFS where vLLM's auto-detection often misses and falls back to slow random mmap reads. It is still the best loader we found for GLM/Kimi; exact wall time depends heavily on cluster cache state.
- `--enable-expert-parallel` — for MoE models with many experts (Kimi has 384), shard them across the TP group rather than replicate. Free win for Kimi-class models.
- `--enable-auto-tool-choice` with `--tool-call-parser kimi_k2` — required for Kimi when running the multi-agent OpenDirac harness, because its agents use API tool calls.

What does **not** help on H100:

- `--load-format runai_streamer` — slower than `prefetch` on Weka (~6 min vs ~2 min for GLM on a warm cache).
- FlashAttention 4 — only supported on Blackwell (SM100+); Hopper falls back to FA3 (which is already what we use).
- ngram / EAGLE / Medusa / MTP / suffix speculative decoding for Kimi-K2.6 — all blocked: Kimi-K2.6 dropped MTP layers, no draft weights ship with it, suffix decoding's `arctic-inference` build needs C++20 `<span>` (GCC 9.4 lacks it), and ngram is incompatible with PP > 1 in vLLM 0.19.1. Pure-TP multi-node ngram works but is slower than the no-spec config because inter-node TP all-reduce dominates.
- `--async-scheduling`, `--mm-encoder-tp-mode data`, and the Kimi-K2.5 Eagle3 draft for Kimi-K2.6 — no throughput win or not runnable. K2.5 Eagle3 cannot be used with PP > 1, and TP-only Kimi trips the multimodal vision-tower path in vLLM 0.19.1.
- `zai-org/GLM-5.1-FP8` on this pip/wheel stack — no-eager repeatedly fails in DeepGEMM FP8 warmup with `CUDA_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`, even with isolated DeepGEMM and TorchInductor caches. Eager FP8 serves, but the best measured MTP=3 run was only ~11 tok/s single-request and ~157 tok/s at 16-way concurrency.
- `--kv-cache-dtype fp8` for Kimi-K2.6 — ~18% slower single-request (per-step dequant) and the only benefit is ~50% KV-cache memory, which is unused: the champion runs at ~12-15% KV utilization at 8-way concurrency.
- Reducing pipeline parallelism (PP=2/TP=8 on 2 nodes vs PP=4/TP=8 on 4 nodes) — gives linear per-GPU scaling (~43 vs ~90 tok/s single-req), no per-request latency win from fewer stages. Benchmark at high concurrency confirms PP depth does not help aggregate throughput: PP=2 peaks at ~2,468 tok/s vs PP=4 at ~2,384 tok/s. PP=2 is the most cost-efficient base config for DP scaling.

To go faster than the per-replica ceiling, use **external data parallelism**: run multiple replicas of the 2-node Kimi serve behind a load balancer.

##### External DP: scaling throughput with multiple replicas

Kimi-K2.6 does NOT fit on a single node (72 GiB weights per GPU; OOM even at 131k context). Native vLLM `--data-parallel-size` requires PP=1, so it cannot be used. Instead, launch N independent serve jobs and either use the load balancer or client-side round-robin:

```bash
# Launch 4 replicas (2 nodes each = 8 nodes total)
./serve/multi_serve.sh --model moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6 --replicas 4 --nodes-per-replica 2

# Benchmark with client-side round-robin across all replicas
uv run python scripts/benchmark_throughput.py --serve-job <job1> <job2> <job3> <job4>

# Or start a load balancer for production use (single /v1 endpoint)
uv run python serve/load_balancer.py <job1> <job2> <job3> <job4>
```

**Measured scaling** (H100 80 GB, max-num-seqs=64, 512 output tokens):

| Config                      | Nodes | Agg tok/s (peak) | Scaling |
|-----------------------------|-------|-------------------|---------|
| 1x replica (PP=2, baseline) | 2     | 2,468             | 1.0x    |
| 1x replica (PP=4)           | 4     | 2,384             | 1.0x    |
| 3x replicas (PP=2 each)     | 6     | 5,205             | 2.1x    |
| 5x replicas (PP=2 each)     | 10    | 11,250            | 4.6x    |
| 8x replicas (PP=2, proj.)   | 16    | ~19,700           | ~8.0x   |

Key findings:
- **PP depth does not increase throughput** (PP=2 ≈ PP=4). More PP stages only add KV headroom.
- **PP=2 (2 nodes/replica) is the most cost-efficient** configuration for Kimi-K2.6.
- **External DP scales near-linearly** — each replica adds ~2,400 tok/s capacity.
- Saturation requires enough concurrent requests to fill all replicas (≥ N × 64).

Local model keys match Hub repo IDs:

- `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B`
- `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16`
- `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16`
- `nvidia/Nemotron-Cascade-2-30B-A3B`
- `moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6` (4 replicas × 2 nodes = 8 nodes; 1T-parameter MoE, native int4 quantization)
- `zai-org/GLM-5.1` (3 nodes; sparse-attention MoE)

#### Step 2: Run the problem

**Recommended: use `serve/eval.slurm`**, which reads the serve job's `endpoint.env` and exports `VLLM_BASE_URL` automatically so the Python client connects to the correct node:

```bash
./serve/eval.slurm \
  --model nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16 \
  --problem problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml \
  --serve-job <JOB_ID>
```

**Alternative: run manually from any node.** Source the endpoint env and run:

```bash
source serve/logs/vllm/<job_id>/endpoint.env
export VLLM_BASE_URL="${BASE_URL}"
uv run python -m open_dirac.one_shot \
  problems/critpt/quantum_error_correction_main.yaml \
  --model nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B-BF16
```

The Python vLLM provider defaults to `http://localhost:8000/v1` but respects the `VLLM_BASE_URL` environment variable, which overrides the default with the serve job's head node IP.

#### Step 3 (optional): Full benchmark sweep

To run the **entire CritPt set (70 problems) in parallel** against a vLLM serve job, use `serve/full_eval.slurm`. It auto-fans out via `scripts/run_critpt_oneshot.py`, with `--concurrency` parallel in-flight requests sharing the same endpoint:

```bash
./serve/full_eval.slurm \
  --model moonshotai/Kimi-K2.6 \
  --serve-job <SERVE_JOB_ID> \
  --concurrency 8 \
  --time 8:00:00
```

Submission JSONs land in `results/critpt_oneshot/<model_slug>/<timestamp>/`. To resume an interrupted run, pass `--resume <DIR>` pointing at that timestamped directory; completed problems are skipped automatically and the original generation/run config is reloaded from `batch_metadata.json`.

## Scripts

### General

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/run_and_verify.sh` | Run a research session then verify results in one command |
| `scripts/one_shot_batch.sh` | Batch-run the one-shot baseline across all problems in a folder |
| `scripts/run_multiple.py` | Run N concurrent multi-agent (open_dirac) instances for pass@k evaluation |
| `scripts/run_multiple_oneshot.py` | Run N concurrent one-shot instances for pass@k evaluation |
| `scripts/run_multiple_rsa.py` | Run N concurrent RSA instances for pass@k evaluation |
| `scripts/run_multiple_autophysicist.py` | Run N concurrent autophysicist instances for pass@k evaluation |
| `scripts/test_model.py` | Smoke-test a model's reasoning and tool-call support (`--list` to show available models) |

### CritPt Benchmark

These scripts run OpenDirac against the [CritPt](https://github.com/CriticalPathAI/benchmarks) benchmark suite (70 problems in `problems/critpt/yaml/`). They produce CritPt-format submission JSONs, support resume from interrupted runs, and handle rolling parallelism.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `scripts/run_critpt_open_dirac.py` | Batch-run all CritPt problems through the full multi-agent pipeline |
| `scripts/run_critpt_oneshot.py` | Batch-run all CritPt problems through the one-shot baseline |
| `scripts/run_critpt_rsa.py` | Batch-run all CritPt problems through RSA |
| `scripts/analyze_batch.py` | Analyze token usage and per-agent metrics across a batch run |
| `scripts/fill_missing_critpt.py` | Fill missing submission JSONs with template answers for a complete 70-problem set |

All batch scripts support `--resume <output-dir>` to continue an interrupted run. On resume, all parameters (model, max_tokens, problem subset, RSA N/K/T, etc.) are recovered from the saved `batch_metadata.json` — no need to re-specify them. Completed submissions are automatically skipped.

```bash
# Fresh run
uv run python scripts/run_critpt_oneshot.py --model gemini-3-flash-preview --output-dir results/run1/

# Resume an interrupted run (all params recovered from batch_metadata.json)
uv run python scripts/run_critpt_oneshot.py --resume results/run1/

# Resume with different runtime settings (concurrency, timeout are overridable)
uv run python scripts/run_critpt_rsa.py --resume results/rsa_run/ --concurrency 5
```

## Supported Models

Models are registered in `models.yaml`. Use the friendly key with `--model`:

| Key | Provider | Model |
|-----|----------|-------|
| `claude-4.6-opus` | Anthropic | claude-opus-4-6 |
| `claude-4.6-sonnet` | Anthropic | claude-sonnet-4-6 |
| `gpt-5.4-high` | OpenAI | gpt-5.4 (high effort) |
| `gpt-5.4-medium` | OpenAI | gpt-5.4 (medium effort) |
| `gpt-5.4-pro` | OpenAI | gpt-5.4-pro |
| `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | Google | gemini-3.1-pro-preview |
| `gemini-3-flash-preview` | Google | gemini-3-flash-preview |
| `deepseek-v3.2` | HuggingFace | DeepSeek-V3.2 |
| `kimi-k2.5` | HuggingFace | Kimi-K2.5 |
| `glm-5` | HuggingFace | GLM-5 |
| `gpt-oss-120b` | HuggingFace | gpt-oss-120b |
| `minimax-m2.5` | HuggingFace | MiniMax-M2.5 |
| `qwen-3.5-397B-A17B` | HuggingFace | Qwen3.5-397B-A17B |

### Known limitations

- **OpenAI `gpt-5.4` + tools + `reasoning_effort`**: not supported on `/v1/chat/completions`. The API returns a 400 error when both function tools and `reasoning_effort` are passed together for `gpt-5.4`, and suggests migrating to `/v1/responses`. As a result, agentic loops (which always attach tools) currently run these models at the API default reasoning effort; the `reasoning_effort` configured in `models.yaml` only takes effect for tool-free calls (e.g. one-shot baseline).

## Architecture

![Architecture diagram](opendirac.png)

Nine agent roles collaborate in a loop. Each agent gets a fresh context per call (no conversation history). All research state lives in a structured `ResearchState` object (persisted as `RESEARCH_GRAPH.json`), with Markdown files rendered from it. The workspace is a separate git repo.

The orchestrator is the only agent that *decides* what to do — it reads ResearchState and calls tools (create RQs, formulate WHs, dispatch researcher/computer, request termination). Everything else is auto-triggered by the engine in cascading fashion.

### Agents

| Agent | Role | Mode | Context source | Mutates |
|-------|------|------|----------------|---------|
| **Surveyor** | Maps the research landscape before the main loop | One-shot | Problem statement + ResearchState | `BackgroundSurvey` on ResearchState |
| **Planner** | Research strategy planning (initial + revision) | One-shot | Problem statement + background survey (+ revision trigger) | Strategy, sanity checks on ResearchState |
| **Orchestrator** | Plans next task, mutates state via tools | Agentic (9 tools) | ResearchState via renderers | ResearchState, `CURRENT_TASK.md` |
| **Researcher** | Analytical reasoning, derivation | One-shot (structured JSON) | Task + target entity + method hints + light state | Evidence on RQ/WH |
| **Computer** | Computational work via code | Agentic (4 tools) | Task + target entity + method hints + light state | Evidence on RQ/WH |
| **Reviewer** | Adversarial review without code | One-shot (structured JSON) | Focused package: WH + evidence + light state | ReviewResult on WH |
| **Deep Critic** | Strategic audit — research direction, coherence | One-shot (structured JSON) | ResearchState via `render_critic_context()` | Critique objects (typed: er/strategy/coordination) |
| **Adjudicator** | Independent evaluation of ER challenges from critic | One-shot (structured JSON) | Claim + challenge + evidence + conventions + ERs | ER demotion or critique dismissal |
| **Formatter** | Produces clean `ANSWER.md` from final research state | One-shot | ResearchState via renderers | `ANSWER.md` |

### Research Lifecycle

The typical lifecycle of a claim: **RQ → evidence → WH → review → ER**

1. Orchestrator creates a **Research Question** (RQ) and dispatches to researcher or computer
2. Researcher/Computer produces **Evidence** (reasoning or code+output), stored on the RQ
3. Orchestrator formulates a **Working Hypothesis** (WH) from the evidence (auto-copies evidence from RQ; auto-triggers review)
4. **Reviewer** examines the WH + evidence (auto-dispatched by the engine)
5. Reviewer submits review (verdict: VERIFIED/REFUTED/INCONCLUSIVE, summary, details)
6. If VERIFIED: engine auto-promotes WH to **Established Result** (ER) when all dependencies are met (cascades to other VERIFIED WHs). If REFUTED: WH is auto-abandoned and logged as a failed approach

Entity numbers are unified — RQ-003 → WH-003 → ER-003.

### Review Stack

Results go through layered review before being promoted to "Established":

1. **Reviewer** — adversarial examination of evidence, methodology, and logical consistency
2. **Strategic critique** — Deep Critic (Strategic Auditor) reviews research direction and inter-result coherence, filing typed critiques
3. **Critique routing** — ER-targeted critiques go to the **Adjudicator** for independent evaluation; strategy/coordination critiques trigger **Planner** revision
4. **Dependency tracking** — All prerequisite results must themselves be Established

Promotion from WH to ER is automatic: the engine's `_auto_promote` fires after a VERIFIED review when all dependencies are established, including cascading promotion of other VERIFIED WHs whose dependencies become satisfied. ERs are immutable — only the adjudicator can demote them (via valid critique). REFUTED WHs are auto-abandoned. Periodic critic passes run every N iterations. A post-integration validation pipeline (`validation.py`) runs 4 checks on ResearchState after every orchestrator pass — demoting unreviewed ERs, stripping phantom labels, and ensuring critique resolution consistency.

### LLM Failure Compensation

LLMs fail in predictable ways (hallucinating IDs, promoting unverified results, emitting malformed output, failing to terminate). The scaffolding compensates via ~40 mechanisms across four categories (defined in `categories.py` as `CompensationCategory`):

- **`call_reliability`** — making each LLM call succeed: transport retry, tool-call fallback, agent loop bailouts, tool execution guards
- **`state_invariants`** — keeping ResearchState consistent: post-integration validation pipeline (4 checks)
- **`loop_control`** — steering the main loop: forced critic, dispatch guards, verdict tracking, compute enrichment, termination gates
- **`output_normalization`** — cleaning agent output: per-agent response corrections, markdown parsing tolerance

All interventions are logged to `EVENT_LOG.jsonl` with category, event key, and detail.

### Workspace Files

All research state is persisted under `workspaces/<run>/` (each run gets a timestamped subdirectory, gitignored from this repo, has its own git):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `RESEARCH_STATE.md` | Established results, working hypotheses, evidence, dead ends |
| `CURRENT_TASK.md` | Current task with YAML frontmatter + structured dispatch context |
| `RESEARCH_GRAPH.json` | Authoritative structured state (ResearchState serialized as JSON) |
| `EVIDENCE_LOG.md` | Log of all evidence and review results |
| `CRITIQUE_LOG.md` | All critiques with severity and resolution status |
| `METRICS.md` | Token usage, alerts |
| `EVENT_LOG.jsonl` | Unified event log — LLM call metadata + scaffolding intervention events |
| `ANSWER.md` | Final formatted answer (written by formatter at end of run, or by the forced formatter on soft-exit) |
| `BEST_GUESS.md` | Mid-run best-guess snapshot (only if `best_guess_every_n > 0`) — never read by agents |
| `VERIFICATION.md` | Independent verification report (written by `--write-report`) |
| `computations/` | Saved Python scripts from computer agent |
| `derivations/` | Saved derivation files from researcher agent |

## Problem Definitions

Problems are defined in YAML files under `problems/`. Each file contains a `problem` field with the problem statement in plain language. Problems with a known `answer` field support auto-evaluation in one-shot mode.

- `problems/tier1/` — 10 core problems (Hawking temperature, QHO thermodynamics, 1D Ising, hydrogen fine structure, Casimir effect, perihelion precession, Berry phase, Chandrasekhar limit, path integral HO, φ⁴ renormalisation)
- `problems/tier2/` — 12 advanced problems (Aharonov-Bohm, bremsstrahlung, Dirac-Coulomb, H₂⁺, 2D Ising Onsager, Lamb shift, Schwinger, Stark effect, Thomas-Fermi, TOV-Buchdahl, Unruh, WKB quartic)
- `problems/critpt/` — Critical-path problems (quantum error correction decomposition)
- `problems/cfg/` — CFG/combinatorics problems
