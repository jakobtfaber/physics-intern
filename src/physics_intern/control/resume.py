"""Resume helpers.

``reconstruct_loop_state`` rebuilds the durable fields of ``LoopState``
from a loaded ``ResearchState``. ``find_last_critic_iteration`` parses
``EVENT_LOG.jsonl`` for the last deep-critic LLM call so the critic
cadence survives a resume. Both are pure helpers with no engine
dependency; ``PhysicsIntern.resume`` wires them in.
